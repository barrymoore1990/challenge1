## Description

This projects purpose was to update the codebase so it follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines
This is important for us to get new business, as how can we market ourselves as the experts when our own website isn't optimised for SEO?

We done this by updating the code:

- Updated div tags to semantic HTML elements
- HTML elements now follow a logical structure
- Images contain alt tags
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Updated page title
- Links all function correctly.
- CSS selectors and properties consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
- Application's CSS file is properly commented.
